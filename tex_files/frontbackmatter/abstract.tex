\chapter*{Abstract}
\label{chap:abstract}
An abstract is a short summary that appears at the start of a longer work, such as a dissertation, research paper or journal article. To write an abstract, you should:
Introduce your topic and objectives
Briefly describe your methods
Summarize your key results or arguments
State your conclusion
The abstract allows potential readers to quickly see what your paper is about and decide if it’s worth reading. It is usually around 150–300 words, but there’s often a strict word limit, so make sure to check the requirements.
